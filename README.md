# Orbital Decay
In Orbital Decay you pilot an advanced space-faring vessel controlling its acceleration, deceleration, and orbital maneuvers. A simulated orbital physics engine allows you to get creative and  decide how to navigate moons, planets, and stars with the goal to spread humanity across the galaxy.

The player directs a vessel’s acceleration, deceleration, and direction. These aspects come together to change and transform the vessel’s orbit around astronomical bodies. This movement system is how the player interacts with the world they are immersed in. The ultimate goal is for the player to colonize the galaxy. While exploring and colonizing, the player will experience unique encounters that add to the world they are a part of, upgrade aspects of the vessel, and add new challenges to accomplishing galactic colonization.
